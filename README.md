# Lost in the Library

## Game Overview:
Lost in the Library is an interactive fiction text-based game. The player awakens in an enchanted library and must through several parts to discover a way out.

## Technology Choices:
Twine, a simple and accessible tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories, was used to develop the game.

## Lessons Learned:
 - **Game Design:** A fundamental challenge was balancing player choice with narrative framework. The game required enough variety to be interactive and intriguing, but too many options may render the tale nonsensical or overwhelming.
 - **Twine Mechanics:** Learning how to use variables in Twine was essential for tracking player progress and generating conditions for several narrative paths.
 - **Narrative Writing:** Writing an interesting, dynamic story is not the same as writing linear fiction. Every choice must be significant and contribute to the progression of the tale, and the writing must react to the player's choices.
 - **Debugging:** The game's testing was an important component of the development process. It was critical to test all conceivable paths to ensure that all links and conditions worked properly and that the story made sense.
 - **Player Experience:** It was critical to guarantee that the game was interesting and enjoyable for the gamer. This included developing a captivating narrative, making the choices relevant, and ensuring that the player understood and followed the game rules.
 - **Scope:** It was difficult to keep the scope of the game manageable. It's simple to imagine a large, sophisticated game, but time limits and the need to keep the game accessible to players necessitated careful planning and prioritizing.
